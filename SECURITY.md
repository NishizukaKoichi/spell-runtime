## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Report vulnerabilities through:

- GitHub Security Advisories (preferred):
  - Repository -> Security -> Advisories -> Report a vulnerability
- If advisory flow is unavailable, contact the maintainer directly and include:
  - affected version
  - reproduction steps
  - impact assessment
  - suggested fix (if available)

## Response Targets

- Initial acknowledgement: within 72 hours
- Triage decision: within 7 days
- Fix timeline: depends on severity and scope

## Supported Versions

Security fixes target the latest published npm version of `spell-runtime`.
